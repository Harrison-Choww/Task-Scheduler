# Task-Scheduler
Task lists where each list includes multiple tasks: task lists can represent larger tasks that have subtasks within them

## Schedule
- When creating the task lists, we first have to create a schedule.
- We are able to add, delete, choose a schedule to edit, and print a schedule.
- When adding a schedule, we are able to name it by entering an ID, description of the schedule, and a date.
- Deleting a schedule will delete all the tasks and subtasks within.
- Choosing a schedule to edit will prompt us to type in an ID to access that specific schedule
- When printing a schedule, it will print the schedule ID, description, date, tasks, and subtasks within it.

## Tasks
- Within the task lists, we are able to add tasks.
- When adding a task, it prompts to enter an ID, decription, and date.
- When deleting a task, we enter the ID to delete that specific task.
- Priority is based on which tasks was inputted first. 

## Subtasks
- Within each task, we are able to add subtasks within them.
- Each subtask has an ID, decription, and date.
- We are able to add and delete subtasks the same way we do with tasks.
